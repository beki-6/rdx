# My Project

QR codes can be generated either using online generator tools or programmatically using APIs.
This node application demonstrates the latter using the QuickCharts API.

QR codes can be of 2 types: Static and Dynamic. This one is static and hence the free API.
Dynamic ones require payed subscriptions. 

# Instructions

Clone the repo
Navigate to the qr-codes directory
Run using "node app.js" command
Once the server is running, open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000
